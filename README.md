- **YAML File to Card Conversion:** Transforms YAML files into detailed PNG cards for NPCs or monsters, complete with stats and other key details.
- **Custom Image Upload:** Users can upload their own images to personalize character cards.
- **YAML Generation Assistance:** For those not familiar with YAML syntax, the tool helps generate prompts for AI tools like ChatGPT to create the required YAML file.

### **I**tem **S**election Based on Rarity
- **Database Item Selection:** Facilitates loot distribution by selecting items based on rarity from the D&D 5e database, speeding up gameplay.
- **Custom Database Integration:** Allows the integration of custom item databases for more personalized gameplay experiences.

### **C**ustom **D**atabase **F**ile Creation Assistance
- **Guided Database Structuring:** Assists users in structuring their custom databases with specific formatting requirements. The tool employs the same AI-assisted prompt generation method as in the YAML assistance. This process helps users adapt their database content into a format that is compatible with DRECINE, making the creation of custom databases more accessible.

## AI Utilization
- **AI Support for YAML File Writing:** AI is used to assist in writing YAML files. Users may opt to use it to automatically generate NPCs, monsters, or entire item databases, but its use is at the user's discretion.
