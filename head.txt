Hey chat, i need a | separated file,with header, i need a database, pick up how many column  the file needs unless i specify that later. The file has to be complete. Do not ask me for the column if I dont specify it, just make it. And even te theme does not provide much information I trust that you can create something. Dont wait for my other input, just make it, just try. Write the entire list and please remember that you cannot write generic stuff, follow the theme. It cannot be an example, it must contain a list of 100 items and please remember that is for dnd 5e so you need to be precise about the effect for example if someone needs to trow a dice, or how much damage it does, effect time or stuff like that.Make also sure that all the items are unique and not repeated. Please dont make a file just write everything in a code box.The database is for DND 5e of 100 items, one of the columns need to be Rarity and it must have a numeric value from 1 to 20, where 1 means common and 20 means legendary, the database has to be with the following theme :
